            <h3>Game Overview</h3>
            <p>HUNTED is a real-time GPS-based pursuit game with players split into two teams: Hunters and Runners. Runners navigate through progressively smaller zones to reach their final target while evading Hunters who track and attempt to catch them by taking their photo.</p>

            <h3>For Runners</h3>
            <p><strong>Your Mission:</strong> Navigate through progressively smaller zones until you reach your final target zone to win.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How Zones Work:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Each Runner has a unique final target location, randomly placed within the play area</li>
              <li>You'll discover your target through a series of nested zones that get smaller as you progress</li>
              <li>When a new zone first appears, it starts <strong>locked</strong> for a short time</li>
              <li>Once unlocked, you can capture it to reveal the next zone</li>
              <li>Each newly revealed zone will also start locked and you must wait for it to unlock before it can be captured</li>
              <li>A countdown at the top of the screen shows when the current zone unlocks, plus how many zones remain</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Location Pinging:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your location is shared with Hunters while you have the app open.</li>
              <li>You can see where other Runners and Hunters have pinged - use this intel wisely!</li>
              <li>If you're already inside a locked zone, stay hidden and wait for it to unlock before opening the app again</li>
              <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Taking too long to reach your final target gives Hunters more time to catch other Runners, who then join the hunt for you!</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Getting Caught:</strong> If a Hunter takes your photo, report it using the "I've Been Caught" button. You'll become a Hunter and join the pursuit.</p>

            <p><i>Being a successful Runner is about staying hidden and timing your movements carefully. Lay low, watch the map, and move strategically.</i></p>

            <h3>For Hunters</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Keep your app open at all times</strong></li>
              <li>View the play area and track Runner locations on your map in real-time</li>
              <li>See where Runners have pinged and predict their movements</li>
              <li>Catch Runners by taking their photo (share it in your group chat as proof!)</li>
              <li>Work together - caught Runners become Hunters, growing your team</li>
              <li>The play area center is typically set to your starting location, so Runners are hiding nearby</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Winning</h3>
            <p><strong>Runners Win Individually:</strong> Each Runner who reaches their final target zone is marked as having "won" - multiple Runners can win!</p>
            <p><strong>Hunters Win Together:</strong> If all Runners are caught before any reach their final target, Hunters win as a team.</p>
